<p>
  My name is Binny Lewis and I am a current student enrolled at the Flatiron Coding Bootcamp's online campus. Through the learn.co portal,
  I am training to be a fullstack developer by adding Ruby on Rails to my repertoire of skills. My desire is to apply these newly gained 
  skills towards a career in project management, leading innovative teams that will bring technology to meet the needs of the consumer, 
  not the other way around.
</p>
<p>
  This is my opportunity to share thoughts on all my various interest. From coding and hackathons, to history and philosophy. I will		
  segment the content for your sake (and for mine) to allow for feedback. One way conversations are never fun. So please reach out via 
  twitter, FB, email, or anywhere else you find my name and a contact link. 
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to hearing from you!
