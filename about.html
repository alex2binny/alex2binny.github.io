  This is my opportunity to share my thoughts on all my various interest. From coding and hackathons, to history and philosophy. I will
  segment the content for your sake (and for mine) to allow for feedback. One way conversations are never fun. So please reach out via 
  twitter, FB, email, or anywhere else you find my name and a contact link. I look forward to hearing what you have to say!
