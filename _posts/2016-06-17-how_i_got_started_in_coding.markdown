While I'm sure you are expecting some amazing story about how I have been coding since I was three years old. Either by arranging magnets on my parents fridge to spell out System.out.println("change diaper now!"); or creating a microprocessor from scratch, the truth, and my story, is just a bit less glamorous. Although I've always been interested in building and designing stuff, the reality is that I have basically sucked at it ever since my brother broke my 4-foot tall custom built K-nex remote controlled robot. After that I became more interested in History. How the world came to be the way it is.

Studying history led me to identify patterns and connections from society to society, from one time period to another. I guess you could say my interest lies in puzzles. Piecing together segments of history where you witness one mighty empire coming to power just as another falls. It made me start thinking. Where do I fit into this picture? Thus I began a journey through a thousand online databases.

Searching records from United States Census, to online indexes from Poland and Ukraine. With each new grandparent identified, a whole new branch of the family tree was added. I began utilizing sites like geni.com, ancestry.com, and recently myheritage.com and familysearch.org. As more and more people added their trees to these online databases, a huge tree began to emerge, one that seemingly connected the entire population of our planet.

But with all this data being added, you could only identify cousins if they themselves or their close family had entered their info into the database. If they nor their family entered their info, I could be sitting next to someone in class and have absolutely no idea that her and I were third cousins. 

The idea for Cousin Connects came to me in about 2013 when an app came out in Iceland which provided an Incest Prevention Alarm for dating singles. You see, the miniature population coupled with nearly 8 centuries of isolation has led most of the country to be related, even if just distantly. With the years of isolation though, they have kept meticulous family histories, which has allowed the app with only minimal parsing to return instant results.

But for my ancestors who came from Latvia, Poland, Russia and others, this would be nearly impossible. What I imagined therefore, was an app that asked specific questions about my family's past and that of my classmate's that would create a prediction model telling me the likelihood that we were related. I needed the skills to do this.

At that time, I was beginning my college career and needed to choose a major that would be a bit more profitable than being a history major (if only for my parents sake). After a second semester as a Computer Science Major, and completing Web Design & Development, I put together a team of fellow Computer Science majors and we began working on solutions. We soon put together a prototype. 

At the time of this writing I have started redesigning the site with the intention of moving away from simple php + mysql structure. My goal is that by attending the Flatiron coding bootcamp I will have the necessary full stack skills to contribute to the design the entire website, front-end and back-end. For Cousin Connects, we will now have the ability to go back and restructure the system using Ruby on Rails. Something I was not able to do while still in college.

Through this process I have explored the world of programming and myself at the same time. Utilizing technology in my search for how my ancestors lives' led to who I am today, has opened my eyes. Realizing just how intertwined we all are, as one large family tree, has changed my perspective on how I view my fellow man. With more tools comes more discovery, something I hope to do as I get deeper and deeper into the world of coding.
