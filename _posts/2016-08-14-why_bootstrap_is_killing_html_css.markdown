While many online courses are still pushing students to learn the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS, twitter Bootstrap has revolutionized the front end industry. On the one hand, I do recognize that any web programmer should kmow at least a bit about how a webpage is structured. But on the other hand, with resources like Bootstrap and open source HTML templates and tools like Squarespace and Wordpress, the future may not hold a large number of positions for frontend web developers.

The first time I'd heard about Bootstrap I thought it was too good to be true. I immediately found the coolest templates I could find and began tailoring them to fit the needs of some other sites I had developed. This was revolutionary for me. Until I started seeing similar templates again and again. Albeit a bit tweaked here and there. One with green as opposed to blue, or one with parallax as opposed to a one page landing. With all the overlapping, I needed a way for my sites to stand out.

So I utilized the most important tool in all programmers' repertoire, youtube, and began building sites from scratch by following some tutorials. Doing this took time. More time than I thought it would. It turns out that although Bootstrap is easy and fun to use, it still takes skill, knowledge, and experience to make good sites. Using Bootstrap certainly does abstract away many of the more annoying parts of html, and even more so for css, but it can still be seen as a tool in and of itself for a designer to master.
